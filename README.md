# musicn.js #

The code in this repository is the beginnings of a compiler for a
MUSIC-V-like language. It is based on a tutorial example given in Max
Mathew's 1969 book "The Technology of Computer Music" (MIT Press).

This code was developed to support a talk I gave at the 1st Web Audio
Conference at IRCAM in Paris in January 2015.
